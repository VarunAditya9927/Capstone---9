# Customer Retention Using Predictive Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying customers who are likely to churn and quantifying their value to the business using predictive Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) modeling. The goal is to help businesses reduce unnecessary marketing costs and prioritize retention of high-value customers.

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess customer data.
- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).
- Segment customers using K-Means clustering.
- Reduce feature complexity with PCA.
- Predict customer churn using ML models.
- Understand reasons for churn using a separate model.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We used two datasets:
- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Demographics, usage, and churn labels.
- `Customer_Churn.csv`: Behavioral and service-related data.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values: Mode for categorical, mean for numerical.
- Converted tenure to years.
- Computed total revenue per customer.
   ### 🔹 CLTV Calculation
CLTV was calculated using the following formula:
CLTV = customer_value × average_tenure
customer_value = avg_order_value × purchase_frequency
avg_order_value = total_charges / total_transactions
purchase_frequency = transactions / total_customers

### 🔹 Customer Segmentation
Used K-Means clustering to categorize customers as:
- High-value
- Medium-value
- Low-value

### 🔹 Feature Reduction
Applied PCA on highly correlated features like streaming services and billing to reduce noise and improve model performance.

### 🔹 Model Building
Used the following models to predict churn:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (including GridSearchCV tuning)

### 🔹 Churn Reason Prediction
Used a separate Random Forest model to identify why customers churn (e.g., better offers from competitors, poor service).

## 🏆 Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall  |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Decision Tree       | 77.71%   | 62.47%  |
| Logistic Regression | 84.74%   | **71.31%**  |
| Random Forest       | 84.32%   | 64.08%  |
| Tuned RF (GridSearch) | 84.46% | 59.79%  |

> Logistic Regression achieved the best recall, making it the most effective model for identifying potential churners.

## 📈 Business Insights

- Focus retention efforts on **135 high-value customers** predicted to churn.
- Main reasons for churn: **better competitor offers** and **poor support experience**.
- Strategic recommendations: **improve pricing**, and **invest in employee training**.

---

## 💡 Future Scope

- Integrate real-time churn monitoring into CRM tools.
- Expand model to other industries (e-commerce, banking, insurance).
- Add deep learning models and SHAP for interpretability.
